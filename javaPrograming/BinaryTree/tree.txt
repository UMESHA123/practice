types:

BFS - breadth first search or level oredr search
DFS - Deapth first search

DFS types
1 - Inorder
2 - Preorder
3 - Postorder

Inorder - left root right
Preorder - root left right
Postorder - left right root

    10
20      30

Inorder - 20 10 30
Preorder - 10 20 30
Postorder - 20 30 10

time complexity -> 0(n)  n - number of node(each node is visited only one time)
space complexity -> 0(h) h - height


the longest of root to leaf path is know as height of the tree.
